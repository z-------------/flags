### Flag file naming guidelines

The general structure of a file name is as follows:

```
[x] [Entity] [alt|sub|x] [Description] [Time period] [Contemporary name].svg
```

The following tags are used for flags other than the official flag of the country/entity:

| Tag | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `alt` | An official variant of the entity's flag. | `Netherlands alt naval jack.svg` |
| `sub` | A subdivision of a country | `UK sub England.svg`<br>`USA sub California sub San Francisco.svg` |
| `x`   | Anything that doesn't fit the other tags | `China x communist party.svg` |

Please take a look at existing file names to get a good idea of how they are named.
